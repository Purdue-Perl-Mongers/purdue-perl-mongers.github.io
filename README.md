# WEBSITE

The Website for [Purdue Perl Mongers](https://purdue-perl-mongers.github.io/), using BootStrap to make a more modern site

## TODO

Most of the page is static, with only the coming events changing. Either make 
that dynamically-generated via AJAX from the Meetup or statically with templates.
(Using CGI or the like on purdue.pl is not yet planned.)

20170209 DAJ Removed Intro To R, Added Gizmo's Async talk
