# WEBSITE

The Website for [Purdue Perl Mongers](https://purdue-perl-mongers.github.io/), using BootStrap to make a more modern site

## TODO

Most of the page is static, with only the coming events changing. Either make 
that dynamically-generated via AJAX from the Meetup or statically with templates.
(Using CGI or the like on purdue.pl is not yet planned.)
